    <p style="background-color: black; color: antiquewhite;" align="large"><a href="https://crisp.nus.edu.sg/~research/tutorial/optical.gif"> Remote sensing</a> is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft). Special cameras collect remotely sensed images, which help researchers "sense" things about the Earth. <br> Some examples are:

        Cameras on satellites and airplanes take images of large areas on the Earth's surface, allowing us to see much more than we can see when standing on the ground.
        Sonar systems on ships can be used to create images of the ocean floor without needing to travel to the bottom of the ocean.
        Cameras on satellites can be used to make images of temperature changes in the oceans.
        Some specific uses of remotely sensed images of the Earth include:
        Large forest fires can be mapped from space, allowing rangers to see a much larger area than from the ground.
        Tracking clouds to help predict the weather or watching erupting volcanoes, and help watching for dust storms.
        Tracking the growth of a city and changes in farmland or forests over several years or decades.
        Discovery and mapping of the rugged topography of the ocean floor (e.g., huge mountain ranges, deep canyons, and the “magnetic striping” on the ocean floor).</p>

        <blockquote align="center" style="color: antiquewhite;" cite="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/backgrounders/remote-sensing"> Sensors, or instruments, aboard satellites and aircraft use the Sun as a source of illumination or provide their own source of illumination, measuring energy that is reflected back. Sensors that use natural energy from the Sun are called passive sensors; 
        those that provide their own source of energy are called <mark>active sensors.</mark>
